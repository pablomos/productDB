I did not get the time to manage to run this application from the command line. Instead, I have been running it from IntelliJ using Jetty. The configuration can be seen in JettyConfiguration.png. I believe the key to running this from the command line would be to use the Jetty start.jar file, as indicated here:

However, I was not able to get it working, so currently it runs within IntelliJ only. Once the configuration is set up as indicated above, the application can then be run by clicking on the "Play" button as indicated in HowToRun.png
